            <h1 id="mainHeader">Welcome to DCI Big 6!</h1>
            <h3 id="mainContent">The world of Drum Corps International is large and wide, 
                and it can be difficult to find everything you need to stay up to date. 
                That's why this website exists - it's the place that pulls everything Drum Crop into one, 
                easily accessible place for unparalleled ease. We feature everything from corps 
                history and recent information, to score breakdowns from Drum Corps Shows past. If you 
                ever have any questions, you can also contact us using the contact page in the navigation
                menu for any specific questions. Still, hopefully, this site can serve as a large enough
                reserve of information for that to be solved as soon as you land here. 
                <br>
                At the top, you will find menu tabs for what we consider to be the top six drum corps in 
                active competition today: The Blue Devils, the Bluecoats, the Cadets, Carolina Crown, the 
                Cavaliers, and Santa Clara Vanguard. These corps represent a large portion of DCI history,
                and we hope to widen everyone's understanding and appreciation of drum corps through the 
                retelling and analysis of the history of these individual corps. This goes without saying, 
                but focusing on the "top six" corps does not discount in any way the tremendous impact of 
                all the other corps - both active and inactive - that have molded drum corps into what it 
                is today, and what it will be in the future. There is also a page dedicated to historical 
                World Championship scores for those of you who enjoy number crunching and analyzing numerical
                trends in a competitive nature.
                <br>
                With that said, prepare to immerse yourself in the robust world that is Drum Corps International, enjoy! </h3>
